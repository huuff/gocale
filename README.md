# `gocale`
`go-i18n` seems to be the most used go localization library. I needed to translate a couple of strings so I reached for it. I almost fainted when I saw that my simple use-case (translate a couple of strings) took around 30 lines of code.

This is a wrapper that tries to provide conventions, configurations, defaults and sensible names wherever I can so it matches my needs. I was inspired by [this helpful issue in the `go-i18n` repository](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n/issues/292)
